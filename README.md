# Vue Vite TypeScript Library Starter

## Why this starter?

I was looking for a hyper-minimalistic starter for a Vue3 library written in TypeScript and using Vite. I couldn't find one, so I made this one. I hope this provides a good starting place for someone wanting a quick start on a Vue3 Vite library.

## Installation

### GitHub Template

[Create a repo from this template](https://github.com/DavidWard98/vue-vite-ts-library-starter/generate)

```

## Usage

## Checklist
